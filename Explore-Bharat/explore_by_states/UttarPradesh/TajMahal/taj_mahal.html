          <h4>Best time to visit Taj Mahal</h4>
         
          <p id="content">
            The best time to visit the Taj Mahal is during the winter months, from October to March. During this time, the weather in Agra is mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from around 10°C to 25°C, making it ideal for exploring the monument and its surroundings. Additionally, the skies are often clear during the winter months, offering optimal visibility and perfect conditions for capturing stunning photographs of the Taj Mahal.
          </p>
          <p>Another consideration is the tourist season in Agra, which peaks during the winter months. While this means that popular attractions like the Taj Mahal may be more crowded, it also offers the opportunity to experience the vibrant atmosphere of the city and participate in cultural events and festivals.</p>
