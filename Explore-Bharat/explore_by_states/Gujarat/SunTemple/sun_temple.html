            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>The Sun Temple in Gujarat, India, located in Modhera, is a stunning testament to ancient Indian architecture and religious devotion. Constructed in the 11th century during the reign of the Solanki dynasty, the temple is dedicated to the Hindu sun god, Surya. The temple was built by King Bhimdev I, who was a devout follower of Surya. Its construction represents the zenith of Solanki architectural style, characterized by intricate carvings, detailed sculptures, and precise geometrical patterns.
          </p><p>
            The Sun Temple of Modhera is divided into three distinct components: the Surya Kund, Sabha Mandap, and Guda Mandap. The Surya Kund, or reservoir, was constructed for ritualistic ablutions before entering the temple. The Sabha Mandap, or assembly hall, is adorned with intricately carved pillars depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, including the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Guda Mandap, or sanctum sanctorum, houses the idol of Surya, positioned in such a way that it receives the first rays of the rising sun during the equinoxes.</p>
